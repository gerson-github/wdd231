        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Site Name:</strong> eRestaurant</p>
        <p><strong>Reason for selection:</strong> Choosing "eRestaurante" as my final project makes sense because it is highly relevant to the real world, as many restaurants are shifting to online ordering and digital menus. This project allows me to integrate a variety of features like menus, orders, reservations, and payment systems, showcasing my ability to work with different tools. It’s a great opportunity to practice essential skills like database management, front-end and back-end development, and UI/UX design. Additionally, the platform can be customized, allowing different restaurants to sign up, create menus, and manage orders based on their needs. The focus on user experience will ensure the site is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and functional. I’ll also design it to be responsive, so it works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops. Beyond just a project, "eRestaurante" could potentially be expanded into a real product that restaurants could use. The creative freedom to experiment with design and features, such as delivery options or customer reviews, makes it an exciting project.</p>

    <section id="site-purpose">
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of eRestaurante is to provide a comprehensive online platform that streamlines the restaurant experience for both customers and restaurant owners. For customers, it offers an easy-to-navigate interface where they can view menus, place orders, make reservations, and process payments all in one place. For restaurant owners, the platform serves as a tool to manage their menu, process orders efficiently, handle reservations, and track customer preferences. eRestaurante aims to improve customer satisfaction by offering a seamless, convenient experience while helping restaurant owners optimize their operations, increase visibility, and boost sales. Ultimately, the goal of eRestaurante is to bridge the gap between technology and the dining experience, making it easier for customers to enjoy their meals and for restaurants to run smoothly.</p>

    <section id="scenarios">
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Long Wait Times at Restaurants: Customers often face long wait times to be seated or served, especially during peak hours. eRestaurante can help by allowing customers to make reservations in advance, view wait times, and even pre-order their meals. This reduces the time spent waiting and ensures a smoother dining experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Manual Order Taking and Errors: Many restaurants still rely on waitstaff to take orders manually, which can lead to mistakes or delays. With eRestaurante, customers can place their orders directly through the website, reducing human error and speeding up the process. This allows the kitchen to prepare meals faster and more accurately, leading to quicker service and happier customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Limited Online Presence for Restaurants: Small or local restaurants often struggle to reach customers beyond their physical location, especially when it comes to offering online ordering. eRestaurante solves this by providing a user-friendly platform where restaurants can display their menus, take online orders, and even offer delivery services, increasing their reach and improving customer access to their services.</li>
